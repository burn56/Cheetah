Requirements:

1- You need to run Windows Powershell ISE as Administratotr

2- Make sure you set the PSexec to folder on Network path or local by ".\PSexec"

3- Make sure you set where you batch scripts on Network folder or local.


I added batch scripts, so you can get a hint.

If you have MSI and you want to edit values; I highly recommends using ORCA MSI Editor by Microsofot

In order to convert your code on Power Shell to EXE, so it can be compiled; I highly recommond using PS1 To EXE:

Note: You will need to check "Require Admin Rights", so anyone will know by default it will need Admin Privillages to run. Otherwise it won't workout.
